# 1) Black holes, telescopes, asteroids/comets, satellites, expansion of universe
# 2) a. Black holes dataset link: https://iopscience.iop.org/journal/0067-0049/page/bass-dr2
#       Consists of a large census of 850+ growing supermassive black holes inclduing data about mass estimates and 
#       emission-line spectrum
#    b. Comet dataset link: https://www.eso.org/public/science/archive/
#       Offers data from European Southern Observatory telescopes, including optical, infrared, and radio 
#       observations including topics about comets.
#    c. wavelength data link: 
#       https://outerspace.stsci.edu/display/SPEARFIMS/File+Names+and+Content#FileNamesandContent-StellarSpectra
#       provides stellar spectral wavelength data
# 3) For the wavelength data I could use use dictionaries and lists to split up the data into different categories 
#    and use functions and for loops to plot (or find a different way) to display the data
# 4) For a simpler version of the project, I could graph wavelengths. For a more complicated project I could display 
# emission-line spectrums from different black holes
